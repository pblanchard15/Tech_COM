<h1>Background</h1>
<p>I am a sophomore at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, IL and
   am majoring in consumer research, analytics, and communications. I am
   originally from Chicago although I spent a lot of my childhood in Glenview
   just outside of the city. I am currently pursuing an internship focused in
  marketing analytics.</p>

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>I am very passionate about the sport of basketball. I am on the basketball
    team at IIT and it is a very big part of my life and has taught me a lot
    about how to work hard and manage my time. Being that basketball and school
    takes up a majority of my time, I do not have too much time for any hobbies.
    However, when I do have free time I usually spend it watching movies or TV
    shows with my family. Currently, our favorite show is <i>The Office</i>
    which we have spent lots of time watching throughout quarentine.</p>
